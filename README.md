spec-md-confluence
===================================


spec-md-confluence is a plugin for [spec-md](https://github.com/leebyron/spec-md) which allows spec-md to produce output in the confluence xml storage format.


# Usage

This requires plugin support within spec-md which is currently in a [PR to be contributed to the spec-md project](https://github.com/leebyron/spec-md/pull/30). At the moment plugin support is designed to be used like so:

`spec-md plugin https://github.com/michaelmccord/spec-md-confluence <path-to-markdown>`


However, please note that this is subject to change, especially after the PR above is adopted.
